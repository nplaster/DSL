#include a test for loading a simple set of rules, such as the rules shown in figure 1.
#For example, I tested the number of products loaded, retrieved the :book product, ensured that the product name was "book" and that it included 2 processes.
#include a test of error handling if the file has a bad method name.
#include a test of doing the processes for a product. Use a product that has at least one parameterized process.
#NOTE: since we are using "puts" for the actions, we can't totally automate this. But we can at least automate running the processes for one product. See figure 3.
